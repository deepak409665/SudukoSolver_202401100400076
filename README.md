Each number 1-9 must appear exactly once in each row.
Each number 1-9 must appear exactly once in each column.
Each number 1-9 must appear exactly once in each of the nine 3x3 subgrids.
The backtracking algorithm is one of the most common approaches to solving the Sudoku puzzle, as it tries all possible values and uses recursion to "backtrack" when a choice leads to an invalid solution.

Steps for Solving Sudoku Using Backtracking:
Find an empty cell: The solver first looks for an empty cell in the grid (usually represented as 0 or None).
Try a number (1-9): For each empty cell, the solver tries placing numbers from 1 to 9.
Check if the number is valid: For each number tried, it checks if placing the number in the current cell doesn't violate any Sudoku rules (i.e., it must not already be in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid).
Recursively solve the puzzle: If the number is valid, place it in the cell and recursively attempt to solve the rest of the puzzle.
Backtrack: If placing a number leads to an invalid solution later on, the solver "backtracks" by removing the number and trying the next one.
Repeat the process until the puzzle is solved or all possibilities are exhausted.
